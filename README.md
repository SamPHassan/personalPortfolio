## Project Overview
For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects that you build in this Path. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that youâ€™ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you.

## Project Objectives:
- Build a website using HTML, CSS
- Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use the command line and file navigation
- Develop locally on your computer
- Deploy your site to the web using GitHub Pages

## Technologies 
- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line and file navigation - Git Bash


## My Project

## To Use
